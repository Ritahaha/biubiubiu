  QQ is the largest number of China 's current use instant messaging software, which is launched by Tencent Nowadays, Internet plays an more important role in our daily life. As the pioneer of domestic social software, QQ created a storm that a mass of people started "making friends" online. Actually, with the development of technology, more social software had been launched. Nevertheless,QQ still remains invincible. QQ has many functions and characters different with other social software. This is the reson why QQ could infiltrate into ourwork, study and entertainment rapidly. So, what makes QQ attract so manypeople? Maybe we can get the answer though learning its property and functions.

  QQ relys on its convenience,innovation and authority,  developing as themost adaptable application. Reasonable interfacial design and abundant choiceof expression animation makes QQ has always been the social app that has mostusers. The basic function of QQ is chatting online. You can use it talking with your friends and family, even strangers. If you know others' QQ number or other information, you can add her or his buddy. Two person that add friends each other could interact. On this basis, QQ has brought out related functions.Such as Qzone, QQ E-mail and video chat. Particularly worthy mentioning is that you can divide all your QQ friends into group. And set or join a QQ group with others who has the same interests like you. You can share items in QQ groups.QQ also has some little games. In the Qzone, you can upload some pictures and write diary. And browse others Qzone. Now QQ released a new version--QQ international. you can not only use it at home, but also aboard. You can choose different language as you like.

  QQ has so many advantages,how about disadvantages? There is no doubt that more popular, more controversial. QQ has some dedly shortcomings. Massive ads, plentiful consumption and badly customizability during install. These all decline the quality of users' experience. For the VIP users,  they  have not many privilige. On the  contrary，they have to pay so much extra money to last the VIP.  It makes users unwilling to pay it. If QQ can solve these problems, I think QQ can be better.

  Personally speaking, I havebeen using QQ for many years. It brings convenience and shortcut. But sometimesit can't be meet my requirements. When I talk to several person at same time, Ii sent messages to a person who isn't the right one. I have no way to solve it except watching it happened. It would be better that I can repeal the messages that I don't want to send. Another demand is for spam.
we can not filtrate them by ourselves' setting. we always receive junk imformations, it makes miss some important messages. For my opinion, we can choose some words as key words, if we receive some message conclude these key words, the system will delet it automaticly. Of course, it should be backups, in case of missing.
   these are all my thought about QQ. Something mabe not right, but it’s all my little idea.
